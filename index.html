            <p>That website includes some programming languages and Frameworks </p>
            <p>Once upon a time, the world of computer programming was a mysterious and exclusive place. Only a select handful of people were considered computer programmers with cutting-edge coding skills. Today, many IT jobs require a solid grasp of the top programming languages, and yes, we mean more than one. 

                If your plans to advance your career or change careers completely require you to master a programming language, you might wonder which one to learn. After all, it will take time and money to learn the language, so you want to make the right choice.
                
                When making your decision, you should bear several considerations in mind, like the difficulty level you‚Äôre willing to tackle, the programming language knowledge you already possess that meshes with your existing coding skills, or your reasons for learning a top programming language. </p>
